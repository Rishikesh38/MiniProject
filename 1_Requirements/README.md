Introduction
---
- This is a Fun Project where I designed a Game called Rock Paper Scissors.
- In my childhood we used to play this game a lot and I feel nostalgic while doing this project.
- It is a simple and easily understandable game.

Defining Our System
---
- A method of selecting, for example, which of two people perform a task: 
- Each person simultaneously makes one of three hand gestures representing a rock, a sheet of paper, and a pair of scissors respectively. 
- Each gesture defeats one and is defeated by one of the other two: 
- Rock defeats Scissors but is defeated by Paper.
- Paper defeats Rock but is defeated by Scissors. 
- The person whose gesture defeats the other is winner.
- In Reallife we use hand gestures but in our digital game we use user input and letters:
- R is Rock.
- S is Scissors.
- P is Paper.
- And the user need to compete with a random generator to win.
